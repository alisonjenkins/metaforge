# Metaforge

Metaforge is a tool for generating metadata for Backstage for components and projects.

It is used to scan a git repositry and identify the type of the project, it's internal dependencies (libraries and repos owned by Brambles) and gather information about the project to then generate an initial metadata file.

The tool can then be ran at a later date to keep the internal dependencies up to date.
